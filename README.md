# YouTube Video Playback App

This project is a simplified YouTube-style web application built with modern JavaScript and web components. It allows users to watch an embedded video with responsive design, timestamp controls, and fast-forward functionality.

## Features include:
- Video playback with fast-forward and timestamp jump
- Responsive design for all screen sizes
- Lightweight and fast performance
- Built with open-wc and modern web standards

## Quickstart
To get started:

```bash
npm init @open-wc
# requires node 10 & npm 6 or higher
```

## Scripts

- `start` runs your app for development, reloading on file changes
- `start:build` runs your app after it has been built using the build command
- `build` builds your app and outputs it in your `dist` directory
- `test` runs your test suite with Web Test Runner
- `lint` runs the linter for your project
- `format` fixes linting and formatting errors

## Tooling configs

For most of the tools, the configuration is in the `package.json` to reduce the amount of files in your project.

If you customize the configuration a lot, you can consider moving them to individual files.
